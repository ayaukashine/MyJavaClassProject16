Methods:
    in Java, a method is a block of code or a collection of statements that
    perform a specific task. It is designed to perform a particular function or
    piece of logic within a program. We can create a method and then call it
    multiple times from different parts of the program rather than repeating the
    same block of code in multiple places Methods in
    java have return types(output of a method) for example void,String int char etc.
    they can also take parameters(input). parameters can of primitive
    and non-primitive. The body of the method can contain any logic like arrays
    loops switch.
why we should use methods?
        1) Code re-usability
        2) Organize the code
        3) changing code becomes easier.
